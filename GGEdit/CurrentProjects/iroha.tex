\textbf{Hyperledger Iroha} is a blockchain framework designed to be simple and easy to incorporate into infrastructure projects that require distributed ledger technology. 

Iroha joined Fabric and Sawtooth Lake to become the third distributed ledger platform under Hyperledger in October, 2016. It was originally developed by Soramitsu in Japan and was proposed to Hyperledger by Soramitsu, Hitachi, NTT Data, and Colu.

Hyperledger Iroha features:
\begin{itemize}
\item A simple structure
\item Modern, domain-driven C++ design
\item Emphasis on mobile application development
\item A new, chain-based Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm, called Sumeragi 
\end{itemize}

Iroha takes a different approach from Fabric and Sawtooth by providing features that are helpful for creating applications for end users.
