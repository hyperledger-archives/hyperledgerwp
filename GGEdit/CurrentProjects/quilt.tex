\textbf{Hyperledger Quilt} offers interoperability between ledger systems by implementing Interledger Protocol (ILP), a payments protocol designed to transfer value across both distributed and non-distributed ledgers. 

At publication date, Hyperledger Quilt was coming soon. 

\subsubsection{About the ILP}
Payment networks today are siloed and disconnected. 
Payments are relatively easy within one country, or if both the sender and recipient have accounts on the same network or ledger. 
But sending from one ledger to another is often impossible. 
Where connections do exist, they are manual, slow, or expensive.

The Interledger Protocol provides for routing payments across different digital asset ledgers, while isolating senders and receivers from the risk of intermediary failures. 
Secure multi-hop payments and automatic routing enable a global network of networks for different types of value that can connect any sender with any receiver.
