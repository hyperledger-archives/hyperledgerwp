The primary drivers for adoption of blockchain in financial service industry are considerations for privacy, confidentiality, and accountability. Compliance guidelines like “Anti Money Laundering” and “Know Your Customer” demand that users/customers are known and have been given clearance by their bank and/or the market infrastructure provider. These requirements drive the adoption of primarily permissioned and private blockchains. Public blockchains still carry the risk of compromising participants' confidentiality and privacy. These considerations together with very large volumes of transactions are the primary reasons that private consortium blockchains are gaining momentum in adoption of distributed ledger technology.

Among various use cases in financial services, and especially in capital markets, post trade activities is one of the prime areas, which can benefit from adoption of blockchain.

In trading post trade processing comprises all activities after the closure of a transaction. This general description is valid for all types of trading, OTC (over-the-counter) trading as well as trades executed at exchanges. OTC trading takes place when the trade counterparties interact directly or via brokerage services.

On a high level post-trade-processing comprises of the following operational steps
\begin{description}
\item [Trade validation] - activities taking place directly after trade execution, mainly validation and confirmation of the actual trading activities amongst the trade participants or through exchange. 
\item [Clearing] - alignment and  matching of the actual trade instructions and confirmations across the different counterparties as well as potential netting activities. In case the counterparties have agreed on bilateral margining or the transactions are cleared through a clearing house the counterparty/settlement risk arising between the time of concluding the trade and the time of settlement (typically 2 - 3 days) is mitigated. 
\item [Settlement] - the (legal) realization of the actual contractual obligations to reach the finality of the transaction. This includes support processes like the notification of all relevant entities affected by the transaction.
\item [Custody activities] - custodians are responsible for the safekeeping of securities. As such the positions held by the trade counterparties have to be adjusted. 
\end{description}

Besides these operational steps, post-trade-processing typically contains reporting requirements regarding the business transaction under consideration. Amongst these are counterparty internal risk reporting\footnote{The contribution of the transaction to the market and credit risk of the respective counterparts} and regulatory reporting. 

The operational steps as well as the reporting activities are in today’s setup typically a fragmented process chain spanning across a variety of departments of the respective counterparties, typically spread across a variety of entities, such as trade counterparties, brokers, settlement agents, central security depositories, clearing houses, thus resulting in a variety of interfaces. This consequently can result in a variety of reconciliation efforts along the process chain, between the trade counterparties as well as other entities/service providers involved, introducing inefficiencies in post trade processing.

Implementing post-trade-processing on blockchain is bound to lead to process efficiency gains as compared to the current implementation model. When settling via a blockchain system one could exploit the peer-to-peer property of a blockchain, i. e. one counterparty would insert the transaction details into the system and the other counterparty would verify and confirm.  Thus the confirmation processes would be processed within the same system, rendering separate confirmation processes obsolete.

In today’s world both parties would independently send their settlement instructions to a trusted 3rd party – the settlement agent – and this 3rd party would match both data sets and further process the settlement. Any mismatches in the initial instructions would lead to reconciliation efforts or even failed trades. In case of a blockchain solution, the network itself acts as an independent trusted 3rd party due to it's immutability and irrefutability of transactions.

The complexity of the multi-party interactions/interfaces is additionally reduced as all data from all from all process steps and actors resides on the blockchain and is accessible on a need-to-know basis. Therefore, the reconciliation processes should become obsolete all together. Also the blockchain based system of record could serve as an efficient basis for reporting activities, e. g. regulatory transaction and trade reporting.

These efficiency gains have significant benefit to trade validation, clearing, both risk and regulatory reporting, as well as some aspects of the settlement phases of post trade processing\footnote{Using blockchain for near-time settlement may eliminate the netting (position offsetting) benefits to the counterparties derived from end-of-day processing, so its utility for the settlement portion of the post trade processing may be limited.}.

\subsubsection{Post trade blockchain requirements}

When looking to apply blockchain to financial services, in addition to the commonly recognized properties of a tamper-proof irrefutable transaction log, a blockchain used for post trace activity it would need to have several features, typically possible with the use of permissioned distributed ledgers.

\subsubsection{Finality}

Nakamoto-style consensus algorithms (such as proof of work, proof of stake, or proof of elapsed time) result in temporary forks, which may lead to transaction rollback. This behavior is not acceptable for capital market use case, since all writes must be final on such ledgers. It is therefore expected that the blockchain applied here will have the ability to use a consensus algorithm, which has immediate finality.

\subsubsection{Confidentiality and Privacy}

Post trade activity participants have the expectation of privacy and confidentiality of transactions. The clearing house recording the transaction must ensure that parties are not able to perceive each others position and trade information. Moreover, the existence of trades themselves, even if parties are anonymized, should not be revealed.

\subsubsection{Performance considerations}

As described above current post trade activities happen at the end of the business day, thus presenting a different set of performance requirements than a system base on a blockchain would have. Still the total number of transactions would increase given the participants' ability to learn their position with the clearing house in near real-time. So while the average transactions per second number would increase, the peak performance requirements would decrease significantly.

\subsubsection{Hyperledger projects for post trade}
\textbf{Hyperledger Fabric} channels combined with separate endorser sets provide an excellent solution to the problems of privacy and confidentiality. Ability to restrict data replication to only permissioned parties brings the benefits of the blockchain got data integrity and non-repudiation of transactions without compromising the security of the data. Additionally, reporting requirements - both internal and external - can be satisfied by including a regulatory agency and other oversight entities in the channel.

Fabric's smart contracts, chaincodes, can be further leverage to provide real-time reporting and, even, potentially risk calculations. The ability to call other chaincodes allows applications both to increase the level of confidence in the data by anchoring\footnote{Recording in an independent immutable public store} it on a different channel and provide consolidated risk view of the market reducing systemic risk.

\textbf{Hyperledger Indy} provides an ability to have unlinkable verifiable claims, which can be leveraged to report outstanding risk on a shared ledger without compromising the identity of the firm, but still allow a regulatory body to have a holistic view of the market, enabling it to prevent potential market crashes and major defaults.
