Hyperledger Composer (\url{https://github.com/hyperledger/composer}) is an extensive, open development toolset and framework to make developing blockchain applications easier. Its primary goal is to accelerate time to value and make it easier to integrate your blockchain applications with the existing business systems. You can use Hyperledger Composer to rapidly develop use cases and deploy a blockchain solution in weeks rather than months. It also allows you to model your business network and integrate existing systems and data with your blockchain applications.

You can use Hyperledger Composer to quickly model your current business network, containing your existing assets, such as tangible or intangible goods, services, or property, and the transactions related to them. As part of your business network model, you define the transactions which can interact with assets. Business networks also include the participants who interact with them, each of which can be associated with a unique identity across multiple business networks.

Hyperledger Composer supports the existing Hyperledger Fabric blockchain infrastructure and runtime, which supports pluggable blockchain consensus protocols to ensure that transactions are validated according to policy by the designated business network participants.
