Hyperledger Iroha (\url{https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha}) joined Fabric and Sawtooth Lake to become the third distributed ledger platform under the Hyperledger umbrella in October, 2016. It was originally developed by Soramitsu in Japan and was proposed to the Hyperledger Project by Soramitsu, Hitachi, NTT Data, and Colu.

Hyperledger Iroha is designed to be simple and easy to incorporate into infrastructural projects requires distributed ledger technology. Hyperledger Iroha features a simple construction; modern, domain-driven C++ design, emphasis on mobile application development and a new, chain-based Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm, called Sumeragi. 

Iroha takes a very different design philosophy from Fabric and Sawtooth Lake, in that it focuses on providing features that are helpful for creating applications for end-users.
