Hyperledger Burrow (\url{https://github.com/hyperledger/composer}) is a permissionable smart contract machine; it became the fourth distributed ledger platform under the Hyperledger umbrella in April, 2017. It was originally developed and proposed to Hyperledger by Monax.

Burrow provides a modular blockchain client with a permissioned smart contract interpreter built to the specification of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Burrow provides a strongly deterministic, smart contract focused, blockchain design to Hyperledger's overall effort. Users of Burrow are able to benefit from having an access control layer through the use of smart contracts and our “secure natives” based permission layer.

The major components of Burrow are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Consensus engine which is responsible for maintaining the networking stack between nodes and ordering transactions to be utilized by the application engine.
\item Application Blockchain Interface (“ABCI”) provides the interface specification for the consensus engine and application engine to connect.
\item Smart contract application engine provides application builders with a strongly deterministic smart contract engine for operating complex industrial processes.
\item Gateway provides programmatic interfaces for systems integrations and user interfaces.
\end{itemize}
